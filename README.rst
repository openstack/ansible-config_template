OpenStack-Ansible config_template
=================================

This module is an ansible plugin that extends regular template functionality
with the ability to override items in config, in transit, through the use
of a simple dictionary without having to write out various temp files on target
machines.

WARNING
~~~~~~~

Installation from PyPI or as a Python module is deprecated and will be removed
in future releases.
Please, use ansible-galaxy to install the collection.
